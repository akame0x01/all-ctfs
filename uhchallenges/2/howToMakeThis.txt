well,we dont have acess to main code..

soo,we have to open this .exe with ida so we can see your code in asm

when analizyng the code,we saw a _read function,this function doesnt have buffer limit!

then now we can break the EIP ;)

but first,we need to find the function with our flag bro.
on IDA we saw the "ret2win32" function,ITS OUR FLAG!
your adress is: 08048632

then, we break the EIP with the function adress and we can capture de flag \o/


adress: 08048632
ret: 44bytes
