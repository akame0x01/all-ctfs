well, first we need to saw the main code,when we do that, is possible see three var and four functions!

i think there are two ways to break this program!

first let me explain what we need to do!

we need to do become all var's to true and call the flag function!

way1 -> we make the all three vars to true adding 1 three times
way1 = buf + call_gets@plt + ret(display_flag_function) + var1


way2 -> way2 is most hard to way1,because we need to enter in all functions and manipulate the vars while that!
i think this might not be possible,so i wont try,but in future you can try if you want
