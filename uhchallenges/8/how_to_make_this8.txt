well,there we go again.

so,basically we will to make a ROPGADGET but i dont know if it is to desactive the DEP, but this seems to be a execve syscall,basically is a function that execute something.

but as the program function uses the function "gets", we have to get careful with the bad bytes,because gets dont accept 00 and 0a(enter).

ok,we are go!

comand to find ROP 
python3 ROPGadget.py --binary ../Ctf's/8/vuln --rop - badbytes "00|0a"

we need to discover the buffer too,lets go
