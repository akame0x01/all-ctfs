### all-ctfs-i-made

well,here are every(or almost it) ctfs rooms that i found interesting to make since i started to studying cybersecurity. some challenges have not an readme.txt or doesn't have any explanation because i probaly had made them a long time ago,but the most have it ;)

probaly every readme will have the passwords,flags,spoilers and something like this because i just do it to document the thing that i'm learning....if you just want an explanation without spoilers or something it is not for you

forgive me for the bad explanations and my english, i'm trying to improve this :)

if you need any help my instagram is pinned to my profile :)
